    body: "With a decade of professional experience under my belt, I have honed my skills as an architect while concurrently completing my bachelor's and master's degrees. Now, I am eagerly seeking opportunities to further expand my knowledge and expertise by pursuing a PhD program abroad. <br> In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also established myself as a successful freelance architect and computational designer. My portfolio showcases a broad spectrum of building designs, ranging from large-scale university masterplans and high-rise office buildings to cozy residential apartments, urban design, and charming villas. My diverse range of experiences has enabled me to approach each new project with a unique perspective, resulting in dynamic and innovative designs that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. <br> My passion for sustainable and green architecture, as well as my expertise in computational design and fabrication, has been the focus of my educational interests and research. I am committed to utilizing cutting-edge technology and methods to create structures that are not only visually striking but also environmentally conscious and energy-efficient. As an aspiring PhD student, I am excited to continue exploring the intersection of sustainability, technology, and architecture, and to develop new ways to integrate these fields in my future work."
