Chintz Plaza is a redevelopment project on the former site of the Behshahr Textile (Chintz) Manufacturing Company in Behshahr, Iran. Established in the 1920s, the factory played a crucial role in the city's economic and social development. For decades, it provided jobs and facilities for the local population, shaping the identity of Behshahr. However, after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, ownership of the factory was transferred to the private sector, leading to a gradual decline. Following years of worker protests and financial struggles, the factory ultimately shut down in 2004. Now, in collaboration with the municipality, the land is being transformed into a mixed-use urban development.

The project reimagines the 10-hectare factory site as a space for community engagement and economic revitalization. Residential areas are planned around the perimeter of the rectangular site, while the central portion is dedicated to a public plaza. Encircling this plaza is a mixed-use commercial and cultural complex, designed as a continuous ring. This layout not only creates a vibrant urban center but also ensures that the site remains a focal point for social and economic activities, much like it was in its industrial past.

A key concept driving the design is the restoration of the site’s historical role as a giver to society. While the factory once supported the city through employment, the new development aims to contribute through cultural and commercial opportunities. The ring-shaped complex around the plaza houses spaces dedicated to celebrating Behshahr’s history, fostering a connection between past and present. By providing platforms for local businesses, exhibitions, and public events, the project seeks to generate new forms of engagement and economic growth.

A distinctive feature of Chintz Plaza is the "experience route," a red-colored path that weaves through the cultural and historical spaces within the complex. This route embodies the principles of the experience economy, encouraging visitors to engage with the site’s heritage through architecture, storytelling, and curated experiences. The emphasis on experiential design ensures that the history of the land is not merely preserved but actively integrated into everyday life.

Beyond its local impact, the project also highlights the broader industrialization efforts in northern Iran. The Behshahr Textile Factory was part of the country’s early attempts to establish modern industries, and its transformation into a contemporary urban space acknowledges this legacy. By blending historical appreciation with forward-thinking urban design, Chintz Plaza aspires to honor the past while shaping a dynamic and sustainable future for Behshahr.
