We undertook a remarkable interior design project for the Naami Sanati perfume store situated in Ava Center Mall, Tehran. Despite the spatial constraints of less than 40 sqm, the design ingeniously accommodates multiple functions: serving as a perfume shop, workshop, classroom, small office, and kitchen. A standout feature of the design is the custom-made furniture, notably the circular main table divided into 6 arcs. This innovative design allows for various configurations, adapting seamlessly to different uses within the compact space.

The choice of materials played a pivotal role in enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. Steel, known for its durability and sleek appearance, was skillfully utilized throughout the furniture pieces, ensuring longevity and a modern aesthetic. Wall-height mirrors strategically placed on the walls not only serve a practical purpose by visually expanding the space but also contribute to a sense of openness and brightness within the interior. This aided us in our commitment to maximizing efficiency without compromising on design quality.

The project's holistic approach is evident in the careful consideration given to each area's functionality. The incorporation of a small office room and kitchen alongside the main retail and workshop areas highlights our attention to detail in meeting diverse operational needs within a confined footprint. This multifaceted design not only optimizes the use of space but also creates a dynamic and inviting environment for both customers and staff alike, embodying Naami Sanati's brand ethos of innovation and practicality in everyday luxury.
