This project centers on a design and research undertaking in the realm of urban design, aimed at harnessing the potential of computer-generated evaluation algorithms. Specifically, the project adopts an Evolution Algorithm Approach that consists of six distinct stages.

The initial phase of the approach involves delving into the research focus to determine the problem of design. Here, the project identifies the challenge by studying urban textures, with a particular emphasis on the deteriorating and aged tissues.

Subsequently, the project team familiarizes themselves with the tools and methods that enable them to simulate and analyze urban textures. The third stage involves the creation or redefinition of alternative urban textures. This stage is unique because the design and production algorithms are concurrently designed, ensuring that the design type is reproducible and generalizable, as required by the computer algorithm approach.

The fourth stage entails measuring the ideas against the identified tools, and in some instances, revising or enhancing the concepts. The fifth and final step involves consolidating the idea and transforming it into tangible architectural structures.

This project adopts a "Bottom-Up Vision" approach to urban design, where the focus is on the community's needs and participation in the design process. Through the utilization of computer-generated algorithms and simulation tools, the project can develop alternative urban textures that cater to the needs of the community, ultimately resulting in a sustainable and livable urban environment.

The Game of Life is a popular example of a cellular automaton. It was created by John Conway in 1970 and is played on an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, with each cell being in one of two states: alive or dead. The game begins with an initial configuration of live and dead cells. Then, in each generation, the state of each cell is updated according to a set of fixed rules.

The rules for updating the state of a cell in the Game of Life are based on the states of its eight surrounding neighbors. A live cell survives to the next generation if it has two or three live neighbors, otherwise, it dies. A dead cell becomes alive in the next generation if it has exactly three live neighbors. These simple rules give rise to complex and interesting patterns that evolve over time, ranging from static patterns to oscillators and spaceships.

The Game of Life and cellular automata, in general, have many applications in various fields, including physics, biology, and computer science. They provide a simple yet powerful framework for modeling complex systems and studying their behavior. The ability of cellular automata to generate complex and unpredictable patterns has made them a fascinating topic for researchers and enthusiasts alike.

To reduce construction costs, this project proposes using modular preconstructed units as building blocks. The algorithm exclusively uses these units, resulting in a cost-effective and innovative solution. Each housing unit consists of interconnected individual blocks, creating a sense of community among residents. This approach streamlines the construction process, allowing for greater design flexibility, durability, and sustainability. Overall, modular construction offers a practical and efficient solution to modern construction challenges.

Incremental housing is an approach to housing development that prioritizes affordability and sustainability by building homes in stages. It involves constructing a basic structure that can be expanded upon over time as the homeowner's financial situation improves. This approach allows low-income families to enter the housing market and build equity over time while also avoiding the need for large upfront payments. Incremental housing is often implemented in informal settlements and slums where housing affordability is a significant challenge. The approach has gained popularity due to its ability to create affordable and sustainable housing solutions, empowering individuals and communities, and providing a pathway to homeownership for those who might otherwise be unable to achieve it.
